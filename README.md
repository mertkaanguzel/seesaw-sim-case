- The project consists of the Weight, Seasaw, and Simulation classes. Since there will only be one instance of the Simulation class, I used the Singleton pattern.
- As a seasaw has many weights and a simulation has one seesaw, there composition relations between classes.
- To make falls smoother, it consists of falling, bouncing and settled states.
- On each weight fall, all the state is saved to localstorage.
- The sim can be paused and resumed thanks to the requestAnimationFrame and cancelAnimationFrame functions.
- I benefited from the sample solution on topics such as static components and their styles.
- Since I wanted to write the project as object-oriented as possible, I used AI for suggestion in this regard.
